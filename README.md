### What is this repository for? ###

This repository is to host the code of (a currently anonymous paper) so it can be reproduced and used in the future.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Dependencies: First, you must have the jupyter environment installed, numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and networkx installed in your Python environment. These are standard python packages for data analysis.
* How to run: Everything is contained and explained in MakePlots.ipynb. This code will load graphs (from the graphs/ directory), and collect experimental data and save it to the .pkl files. The rest of the code will make the respective plots from the paper and save them to the plots/ directory.
