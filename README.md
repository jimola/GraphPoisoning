### What is this repository for? ###

This repository is to host the code of [a paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14376)  so it can be reproduced and used in the future.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Dependencies: You must have jupyter, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, and networkx installed in your Python environment.
* How to run: Everything is contained and explained in MakePlots-new.ipynb. This code will load graphs (from the graphs/ directory), and collect experimental data and save it to the .pkl files. The rest of the code will make the respective plots from the paper and save them to the plots/ directory.

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Repo owner: [Jacob Imola]
